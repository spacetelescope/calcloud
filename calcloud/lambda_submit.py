"""This module is the primary path for job submission, for both
initial "placed" submissions and "rescue" submissions which are
triggered by the corresponding lambdas.

The key difference between "placed" and "rescue" submissions is that
placed submissions reset job control metadata to initial conditions
(primarily no retries yet) while rescue submissions merely use the
existing control data to drive job planning and job definition
(memory allocation) selection.

See the batch_event handler, rescue handler, and s3_trigger
handlers for more information on how jobs are initiated and
retried.
