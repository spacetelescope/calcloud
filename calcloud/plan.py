# For optimization with AWS Batch, key insights are:
#
# batch-queue    -- defines which compute environments to execute on which in turn select EC2 instance types
#                   instance types in turn define available cores and memory.  the larger the instance,  the
#                   greater the chance that it will spend some portion of its lifespan with unused resources.
#
# job-definition -- defines which Docker container to run, the command line, and default resource constraints
#
# job -- can override resource constraints
#
# vcpus, memory -- will influence how the AWS Batch scheduler packs jobs onto workers.
#
# long bombing -- the AWS Batch auto-scaler tends to throw long bombs,  if you request a thousand jobs it will
#                 max out worker instances to the level limited by the compute environment.   This means that
#                 a major factor in amortizing the startup+shutdown costs for workers is limiting workers to
#                 the level that they each run a number of jobs with a total runtime scaled to match some
#                 multiple of the startup+shutdown.   E.g. if the total runtime == startup+shutdown,  50% of
#                 the instance's total lifespan is spent starting up and shutting down vs. doing actual work.
#                 An integer multiple isn't required.
